# Description

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Source Data

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository

The source data for this project can be found here.

## Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in

- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt
Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

# Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Create a logcal vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others. Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

# Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Merge data subset with the activityType table to cinlude the descriptive activity names

# Section 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.

Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

# Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject


  The following is paraphrased from the README file from the above url. This data provided data on a group of 30 volunteers between the ages of 19-48 years. Each subject performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone on their waist. The experimenters measured the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz and video-recorded the experiments to label the data manually. The resulting dataset was randomly split into two sets, where 70% of subjects were used to generate the training data and 30% the test data. 
  
  The run_analysis function first creates a directory, ./data, and downloads the zip file url into that file. It then unzips the dataset to the ./data directory. This creates a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset". 
  
  Next, all the relevant files from the "UCI HAR Dataset" are read by read.table into variables for manipulation within the function:
  - features.txt - this file is read and stored into the variable "features"
  - activity_labels.txt - this file is read and stored in the variable "activity_labels"
  - subject_test.txt - 
  - y_test.txt - 
  - X_test.txt - 


For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
